Christian historical fiction author Carrie Fancett Pagels, Ph.D., will be visiting the Shepherd Community Library on Monday, August 1 from 3 - 4 p.m. Pagels will discuss her recently published novella The Substitute Bride.

Here is a little bit more information:

Carrie enjoys reading, traveling, baking, and beading—but not all at the same time! Many of her stories are set in Michigan, where she grew up. Possessed with an overactive imagination, she loves sharing her stories with others. A psychologist for twenty-five years, she is no longer practicing. Married for almost thirty years to the man of her dreams, with a teenage son and adult daughter, Carrie resides in Virginia's Historic Triangle, which is perfect for her fascination with history. Administrates two popular group blogs: www.OvercomingWithGod.com and www.ColonialQuills.org.
